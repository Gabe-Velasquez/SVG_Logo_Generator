  ## Description <a name='description'></a>
  This application was a module assigned for our  coding bootcamp. We were tasked to build a SVG logo generator that is compiled from a user's inputs and preferences. 

  ## Installation <a name='installation'></a>
  For this project to work, node needs to be installed in the project environment in order for inquirer to prompt questions for the user. Jest was used for testing purposes. 

  ## Usage <a name='usage'></a>
  The application will ask the user a series of questions from what colors are used, characters  to be shown and what shapes will be used as their logo. Quick demonstration attached below. <br>

  ## Contribution <a name='contribution'></a>
  For a lot of this project, I had to refer to MDN and referred to this youtube video from Kevin Powell (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJSCl6XEdP8). I met with a tutor to go over how classes worked and how I can implement them in my project. 

  ## Tests <a name='tests'></a>
  Used jest to conduct tests in my project to test classes for each shape inputs along with color variables.
